        The maximum amount of days a commit at the head of a branch, tag or pull request
        may be old before being ignored. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Branches, tags or pull requests older than this will be ignored.
    	The default is <strong>0</strong> which basically deactivates this feature.
    	If the value is changed to any positive number above <strong>0</strong>, 
    	branches, tags or pull requests older than the amount of days mentioned
    	will be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
    	As a basis of the time-restriction, the last modification timestamp of the head commit 
    	is used together with the current system time. If the current system time is 
    	2020-01-10 11:20 AM GMT and the maximum commit age is set to 3 days, anything after
    	2020-01-07 11:20 AM GMT (system time) will be built. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	If a new tag or branch is created with an old head commit, it is possible that the 
    	filtering mechanism will ignore this "new" branch or tag even though it just was 
    	created a few moments ago. This is due to the fact that git only tracks timestamps
    	of commits and not those of branches, tags or pull requests. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Some SCM plugins do not support the retrieval of timestamps of commits. In this
    	case the time-restriction will be ignored. Known plugins in which this is the case 
    	are the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/mercurial-plugin">mercurial plugin</a>
    	and some cases in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitea-plugin">gitea plugin</a>.
    	There are also some error cases where within SCM plugins that might cause this feature
    	to be disabled.
    	Nonetheless, the support for this feature in general is good and should not cause any
    	issues with most plugins.
